## Description
The motivation for this project was to start from scratch and learn as much as I could about javascript. I built this project so I could know what level of understanding I have of javascript. I was able to solve many bugs along the way and piece together code that meets most of the acceptance criteria. I unfortunately ran out of time. I learned a lot about DOM elements, adding event listeners, and local storage. I will continue to work on this project because it is a great learning project.
